# Message Board


## Installation

Message Board is made with Meteor so to install it on your computer see this [link](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install/)

Once Meteor is installed, run this script :

```console
npm i
Meteor run
```

## Using the message board
In this web app you will be able to :
- Create, modify and delete a message.
- Put a message in private mode or public mode.
- Filter the messages by only seeing yours or others.
- Add, modify and delete comments on existing messages.
- Put a comment in private or public mode.

In order to test this web app in the simpliest way, three profiles are already created. It will be enough to test all scenarios. If the message board is becoming a little messy, feel free to hit the "Clean board" button in the login page, it will clean the board for you.

If you don't want to run the web app locally, it is waiting for you on this [link](https://message-board.meteorapp.com/)

Hope you will enjoy it !
